# hello-world
It is my first project to try on Git hub
I am on my own projects of machine learning and hope to find a job of MLE or DS.
I love topics about educating, technology, anthropology and economy. To put them in, I want build a web or app to help children to learn to speak some basic words of different languages, like Mandarin, English, French, Japanese, German and so on. 
So, for me, the first thing is to define the problem and plan how to achieve my goal. Along with building the project, I may get a lot of unexpected problems on which I can get more experience to succeed. 
Hope to have a good trip with this project!
